# Recitation 01 Homework

Your homework following the first recitation is to ensure that you have a working
virtual machine and recitation assignment repository by modifying this file,
**README.md**, tracking it with git, commiting your changes, and pushing them
to GitHub.

Your assignment is to replace all instances of !!GITHUB-USERNAME!! in this file with
your GitHub username - NOT your NetID nor your full name! 

If you have done this correctly, when you check this file on the GitHub website, the link
below should lead somewhere.
[Click me](https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/recitations-!!GITHUB-USERNAME!!/blob/master/r01/.ignoreme/SUCCESS.md).

By signing this document by inserting my GitHub username where specified above, you promise
that you modified this file within your Virtual Machine, and not on the GitHub website.

I, !!GITHUB-USERNAME!!, promise.

You also promise that you will not directly use the power-off function of VirtualBox,
and instead will always initialize a proper shutdown through Lubunutu.

I, !!GITHUB-USERNAME!!, promise.

You also promise that you will always `git add` your changed and created source files,
commit them with `git commit`, and `git push` them for all assignments in this course.

I, !!GITHUB-USERNAME!!, promise.

You also promise that you will push code before all assignment deadlines and check
that your changes are present on the GitHub website.

I, !!GITHUB-USERNAME!!, promise.

Finally, you promise that you have cloned both your recitations repository
as well as your lab1 repository to your VirtualMachine by the end of today.

I, !!GITHUB-USERNAME!!, promise.
